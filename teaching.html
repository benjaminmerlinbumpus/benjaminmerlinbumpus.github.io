I am currently running a Graph Theory and Algorithms Reading Group within the School of Computing Science. 
The reading group is a weekly event which I encourage you to participate in. 
If you would like to get involved, send me an email and let me know what you would be interested in learing! <br>
I also am involved in a few <a href="./outreach.html">outreach teaching activities</a>, so make sure you have a look at those too!
<h2>Courses Taught: </h2>
-- Algorithms and Data Structures II (2019) <br> 
-- Algorithms and Data Structures (Masters level) (2018, 2019)<br>
